# GioCoinUI

As a geocaching blockchain proof of concept, this repository will contain all UI elements. Initially, a React.js web page will be included, but this repo will also contain a phone application used to map location and initialize token contracts. It might also have a social media component, but that is up for scope



The merit of this project is to explore the development of blockchain applications.
